It answers product-related questions like:
- Specifications

- General FAQs (shipping, return policy, etc.)

## ü§ñ How it works

- Frontend: Simple UI to ask product-related questions
- Backend: Python Flask app
- AI: Uses OpenAI or similar LLMs to answer contextually from a fixed dataset
- Products: Data stored in JSON (for demo) but can be switched to MySQL/PostgreSQL
- Tools: The `/tools` folder will contain additional scripts (e.g., price scrapers, order bots, etc.)
